# Availity Homework React App 

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Getting Started

If you would like to run locally, you can run 'npm install' followed by 'npm start'. You will also want to pull down the backend project located here - https://github.com/Hyiero/availity-backend 

After you have pulled down the backend, you can run that in IISExpress as the project is configured with a specific port for IISExpress in which the development version of this react app works with. If for whatever reason you change this port you will want to go to the .env.development file in the react app and fill in your custom port there so the frontend can talk with the backend.

Also if you do not want to pull and run the project locally that is no problem as you can find a completely deployed version of the site here - https://availity-homework.azurewebsites.net
